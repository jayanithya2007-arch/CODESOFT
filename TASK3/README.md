This project focuses on developing a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator includes a display screen to show user inputs and results and supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. CSS Grid is used to neatly arrange the buttons, while JavaScript manages user interactions and performs calculations using event listeners and conditional statements.
